MULTI-AGENT OPTIMIZATION FOR CYBER-RISK MANAGEMENT
5-Year Analysis Results Summary
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This analysis evaluates multi-agent optimization for cyber-risk management
across four threat scenarios over a 5-year horizon. The framework uses
executive agents (CFO, CRO, COO) with personality-driven decision-making
to optimize budget allocation (F1-F4) and achieve optimal balance between
accumulated profit and systems at risk.

KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Profit Range: $3,985,000 to $13,224,094
2. Systems at Risk Range: 25.0 to 90.0

3. Collaborative agents generally achieve:
   - Better profit optimization in deterministic scenarios
   - More consistent risk management

4. Risk tolerance significantly impacts:
   - Profit vs risk trade-offs
   - Strategy adaptation over time

5. Scenario-specific insights:
   - Advanced attacks require different optimization strategies
   - Ransomware scenarios show higher variability
   - Unpredictable attackers require more adaptive responses
